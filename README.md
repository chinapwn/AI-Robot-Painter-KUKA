## Overview

- **Paints or draws anything.** Paint any kind of single-, or multi-colored picture with your KUKA robot.
- **Multicolor.** Choose as many colors as you want. Supports acrylic, oil, pencil and many more.
- **Flexible setup.** You only need to measure canvas base and teach color refilling or tool switching paths.
- **Pretty safe.** Only generates 2D-coordinates that fit the canvas size, set by the user.
- **Easy to configure.** Use the intuitive python CLI-tool or change the reasonably messy python code.
